#  Heart Disease Prediction - ML Pipeline

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline to **predict the risk of heart disease** using the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ketangangal/heart-disease-dataset-uci/discussion?sort=hotness).

## Features

✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
✅ Feature Selection & PCA  
✅ Supervised Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)  
✅ Unsupervised Models (K-Means)  
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)  
✅ Real-Time Prediction via Streamlit UI  
✅ Public access using Ngrok  
✅ Project hosted on GitHub

- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit, Pyngrok
- Pickle (for model export)

## How It Works

1. Preprocessed and scaled the dataset  
2. Selected key features ('Max_heart_rate', 'oldpeak', 'chest_pain_type_Typical angina', 'thalassemia_Reversable Defect', 'exercise_induced_angina_1', 'cholestoral' )  
3. Trained and evaluated multiple ML models  
4. Tuned the best-performing model (Random Forest)  
5. Saved the model using `pickle`  
6. Built a Streamlit app for real-time predictions  
7. Shared via Ngrok tunnel
